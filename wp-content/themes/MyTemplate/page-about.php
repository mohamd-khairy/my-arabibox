                        Our Arabic curriculum is developed by leading Arabic teachers and educators with
                        over 15 years of teaching beginners Arabic. The curriculum is designed to enable a
                        child, with the help of their parents or guardian, to begin reading Arabic in as
                        little as 6 months. This timeframe can be shortened or prolonged in accordance with
                        a child’s own pace.

                        Children vary in their learning pace and it is important that as educators, we are
                        respective of this. So although our curriculum is designed to fit a 6 month learning
                        routine, it is important that we are considerate of each child’s unique learning
                        styles and pace and to work with them accordingly.

                        Children make creative choices in their learning and by giving them the right tools,
